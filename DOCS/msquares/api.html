<h1>Module <code>luaffifb</code></h1>
<p>Corona binding for <a href="https://github.com/facebook/luaffifb">luaffifb</a>, a library for calling
 C functions and manipulating C types from Lua.</p>
<p> It is designed to be interface-compatible with
 the FFI library in LuaJIT (see <a href="http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html">here</a>). It can parse C function
 declarations and struct definitions that have been directly copied out of C header files and
 into Lua source as a string.</p>

<p> This is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/jmckaskill/luaffi">luaffi</a>.</p>

<h2> Documentation</h2>
<p> This library is designed to be source-compatible with LuaJIT's FFI extension. The documentation <a href="http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html">here</a>
 describes the API and semantics.</p>

<h2> Pointer Comparison</h2>
<p> Use <code>ffi.NULL</code> instead of <code>nil</code> when checking for <code>NULL</code> pointers.</p>

<pre><code>ffi.new('void *', 0) == ffi.NULL -- true
</code></pre>


<h2> Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
    <li><p>Comparing a ctype pointer to <code>nil</code> doesn't work the same as in LuaJIT (see above).
    This is unfixable with the current metamethod semantics.</p></li>
    <li><p>Constant expressions can't handle non integer intermediate values (eg
    offsetof won't work because it manipulates pointers)</p></li>
    <li><p>Not all metamethods work (e.g. char* + number). This is due to
    the way metamethods are looked up with mixed types in Lua 5.1. If you need
    this use boxed numbers (uint64_t and uintptr_t).</p></li>
    <li><p>All bitfields are treated as unsigned (does anyone even use signed
    bitfields?). Note that "int s:8" is unsigned on Unix x86/x64, but signed on Windows.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2> Corona-specific changes</h2>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://docs.coronalabs.com/api/library/global/tonumber.html">tonumber</a> and <a href="https://docs.coronalabs.com/api/library/global/type.html">type</a>
    are left intact. For the FFI-aware behavior, stick to <code>ffi.number</code> and <code>ffi.type</code>.</li>
    <li>To play nice with plugins, library loaders of the <code>luaopen_*</code> kind are rejected by <code>ffi.cdef</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2> How it works</h2>
<p> Types are represented by a struct ctype structure and an associated user value
 table. The table is shared between all related types for structs, unions, and
 functions. Its members have the types of struct members, function argument
 types, etc. The struct ctype structure then contains the modifications from
 the base type (e.g. number of pointers, array size, etc).</p>

<p> Types are pushed into Lua as a userdata containing the struct ctype with fenv
 set to the shared type table.</p>

<p> Boxed cdata types are pushed into Lua as a userdata containing the struct
 cdata structure (which contains the struct ctype of the data as its header)
 followed by the boxed data.</p>

<p> The functions in <code>ffi.C</code> provide the <code>cdata</code> and <code>ctype</code> metatables and ffi.*
 functions which manipulate these two types.</p>

<p> C functions (and function pointers) are pushed into Lua as a Lua C function
 with the function pointer cdata as the first upvalue. The actual code is JITed
 using dynasm (see call_x86.dasc). The JITed code does the following in order:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Calls the needed unpack functions in <code>ffi.C</code> placing each argument on the HW stack</li>
    <li>Updates <code>errno</code></li>
    <li>Performs the C call</li>
    <li>Retrieves <code>errno</code></li>
    <li>Pushes the result back into Lua from the HW register or stack</li>
</ol>
