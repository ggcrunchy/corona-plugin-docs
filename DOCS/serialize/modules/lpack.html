<h1>Module <code>lpack</code></h1>
<p>Corona binding to lpack, a simple Lua library for packing and unpacking binary data.</p>
<p> The library contains two functions: pack and unpack.</p>

<p> pack is called as follows: pack(F,x1,x2,...), where F is a string describing
 how the values x1, x2, ... are to be interpreted and formatted. Each letter
 in the format string F consumes one of the given values. Only values of type
 number or string are accepted. pack returns a (binary) string containing the
 values packed as described in F. The letter codes understood by pack are listed
 in lpack.c (they are inspired by Perl's codes but are not the same). Numbers
 following letter codes in F indicate repetitions.</p>

<p> unpack is called as follows: unpack(s,F,[init]), where s is a (binary) string
 containing data packed as if by pack, F is a format string describing what is
 to be read from s, and the optional init marks where in s to begin reading the
 values. unpack returns one value per letter in F until F or s is exhausted
 (the letters codes are the same as for pack, except that numbers following `A'
 are interpreted as the number of characters to read into the string, not as
 repetitions).</p>

<p> The first value returned by unpack is the next unread position in s, which can
 be used as the init position in a subsequent call to unpack. This allows you to
 unpack values in a loop or in several steps. If the position returned by unpack
 is beyond the end of s, then s has been exhausted; any calls to unpack starting
 beyond the end of s will always return nil values.</p>

<p> This code is hereby placed in the public domain.
