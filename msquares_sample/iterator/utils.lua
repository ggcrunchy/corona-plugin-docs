--- Apparatus for building stateful iterators which recache themselves when iteration
-- terminates normally, of which multiple instances may be in use at once.
-- @callable builder Function used to build a new iterator instance when none is available
-- in the cache. It must return the following functions, in order:
--
-- * _body_: As with standard iterator functions, called as
--    <pre>var\_1, ..., var\_n = body(s, var)</pre>
-- where the _var_\* are loop variables, _s_ and _var_ are the state and iteration variable.
-- * _done_: Called as
--    <pre>is\_done = done(s, var)</pre>
-- If _is\_done_ is true, the iterator terminates normally and calls `reclaim(s)`; otherwise
-- the _body_ logic is performed.
-- * _setup_: This takes any iterator arguments and returns _s_ and the initial value of
-- _var_. Any complex iterator state should be set up here.
-- * _reclaim_: May be absent, in which case it is a no-op. Called as
--    <pre>reclaim(s)</pre>
-- Any complex iterator state should be cleaned up here. If _reclaim_ must be paranoid that
-- it terminated normally (namely, that the **for** loop terminated), preparation should be
-- done in the false branch of _done_.
--
-- Afterward this instance is put in the cache.
--
-- This design encourages storing an instance's state in _builder_'s local variables,
-- which are then captured. Thus the above functions will typically be new closures.
-- @treturn function Iterator generator, called as
--    for LOOPVARS in gen(...) do
-- or (where _reclaim_ may be needed) fetched as
--    func, s, var, reclaim = gen(...)
-- where any arguments are passed to _setup_. If it is necessary to build an instance first,
-- _builder_ will receive these arguments as well.
--
-- Note that _reclaim_ is returned. This can be used to manually recache the iterator if the
-- code needs to break or return mid-iteration, though if forgotten the instance will just
-- become garbage.
